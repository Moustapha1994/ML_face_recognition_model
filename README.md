# ML_face_recognition_model
My cnn deep learning recognition model


In this repository, we develop a facial recognition model with machine learning algorithms

We did it with google collab and the project details and code are dand the file.ipynb


To use the Faces_images dataset, it will first need to unzip the directory.


To use this project, just clone it, and open it on google collab or anaconda jupyter and run each of the cells after installing all the necessary libraries
